This is the Official repository for the landing page of the QUITEL (XLVI International Congress of Theoretical Chemists of Latin Expression).

In association with the deparment of BioInformatic at the Uruguayan Public University - UDELAR.

The focus of this website is to allow different users who wish to attend this conference, either as participants or guests, to preliminarily complete a pre-registration form, thus highlighting their interest in attending.

After completing the pre-registration, if the individual confirms their attendance, they must fill out the full registration form.

This data is stored in a MongoDB database since there is no need for relationships between the various database tables.

Once registered, if they are participants, they can access the final form where they can submit different abstracts or posters, which will be evaluated by the committee in charge of this edition of the conference.
