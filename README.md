# 🎭 QUITEL - XLVI International Congress of Theoretical Chemists of Latin Expression

Welcome to the **official repository** for the landing page of **QUITEL (XLVI International Congress of Theoretical Chemists of Latin Expression).** 🎉

## 🔬 About QUITEL

📍 **In association with the Department of Bioinformatics at the Uruguayan Public University - UDELAR**.

The goal of this website is to provide a **preliminary pre-registration form** for those interested in attending the congress, whether as **participants** or **guests**.

Once pre-registered, attendees who confirm their participation will need to **complete a full registration form**.

🗃️ The collected data is stored in a **MongoDB database**, as it does not require relational structures.

For **participants**, there will be an additional **final form** where they can submit **abstracts** or **posters**, which will be **evaluated by the committee** in charge of this edition of the conference.
